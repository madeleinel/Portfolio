              A platform which matches self-identifying women who want to get started in the tech industry with mentors who are working within the industry. </br> </br>
              The website was created as part of the <a href="http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/" target="_blank">Code First: Girls</a> 
              Advanced Python Web Development Course competition with <a href="https://github.com/eleanombre" target="_blank">E Keane</a>. </br> </br>
              The platform database is currently being updated and more features, such as matching up mentors and mentees based on their preferred 
              languages and what type of help they are looking for or can provide, are being added.
