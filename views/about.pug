      p.text.
        I am a full-stack developer with a First Class BSc (Hons) degree in Psychology and an international background in administration and project 
        management. Iâ€™m passionate about coding, thrive on new challenges and am always looking for ways to develop and improve my work. </br> </br>
        During Spring 2017, I completed two short courses through <a href='http://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/' target='_blank'>Code First: Girls</a> 
        (Beginners HTML/CSS Web Development and Advanced Python Web Development), and a short course on Advanced JavaScript at 
        <a href='http://www.city.ac.uk/study/short-courses' target='_blank'>City, University of London</a>. </br> </br>
        I am currently completing an internship as a technologist at <a href='https://madebymany.com/' target='_blank'>Made by Many</a>, where I am 
        building a prototype using Node/Express, Postgres/Sequelizer, Passport.js/bcrypt, ES6 and HTML5/CSS3.
      //- also go into the research, synthesising/mapping and user testing process -- mention that I'm the only developer on the project
