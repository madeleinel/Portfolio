        <p>A drawing application which allows the user to draw on a canvas and customise features such as brush stroke colour, size and effects, changing the background colour independently from the drawing itself, and undoing drawing actions.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The drawing application was inspired by Wes Bos’s <a href="https://javascript30.com/" target="_blank">JavaScript30</a> HTML5 canvas tutorial. The canvas and the basic drawing feature was set up using this tutorial, and all additional features have been added using ES6.</p>
        <p>More features are in the process of being added.</p>

        <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
        <p>¬ HTML5 Canvas to set up the canvas</p>
        <p>¬ ES6 to enable the drawing features</p>
        <p>¬ HTML5 and CSS3 to style the site</p>

        <h2>Challenge 1</h2>
        <p>Enable the user to add brush effects.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="leftAlign">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Added event listeners to listen for changes within the effect list elements; when registering a change, it loops through the list to see which option element was chosen, and then sets the drawing effect to be the value of that option.</p>

        <h2>Challenge 2</h2>
        <p>Ability to change the background colour without overwriting the current drawing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="leftAlign">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>Added a secondary canvas below the primary one, and made the background of the primary canvas transparent.</p>

        <h2>Challenge 3</h2>
        <p>Enable the user to undo each drawing action.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="leftAlign">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>When start each new drawing action, the system saves the last version of the site to an array. When clicking the Undo button, the canvas is restored to the top item of the array, and that item is then removed from that array to enable the user to undo all drawing actions one by one.</p>

        <h2>Challenge 4</h2>
        <p>Make the controls (the input elements) look nicer, while still displaying the current values (e.g. the current brush and background colours, the brush thickness, and the chosen brush effect.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="leftAlign">
        <h2>Solution</h2>
        <p>The default styling of the HTML input elements was overwritten using span elements. To enable the span elements to display the current values, ES6 was used to update the look of these elements each time the value is changed within the JavaScript code.</p>
